TO DO LIST for v0.4.0

1. Curses windows

The use of windows is a must for any user interface. As our interface gets
more and more complicated, we need to implement the use of windows. Our
interface needs the following windows:

T1.1 Cards on table
T1.2 Cards in player's hand
T1.3 Score table

The windows are to be redrawn at every function call.

T2. Color suits

Color suits differently for better readability.

T3. Add tests for newly created functions.

T3.1 Add tests for game_findNextAllowedCard()
T3.2 Add tests for game_findPreviousAllowedCard()

T4. Tests for game_createGame() are failing, probably because of the new
    restrictions for its argument in debug mode.

T5. There are some issues with names:

T5.1 Allow space character inside a name.
T5.2 Check for buffer overflow when reading a name.
T5.3 Remove team name member.

T6. Create multiple build targets (release and debug) and find a way to allow
    configure on machines without cutter installed.
